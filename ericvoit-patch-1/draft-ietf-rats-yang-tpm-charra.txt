   A YANG Data Model for Challenge-Response-based Remote Attestation
                         Procedures using TPMs
                 draft-ietf-rats-yang-tpm-charra-latest

Abstract

   This document defines YANG RPCs and a small number of configuration
   nodes required to retrieve attestation evidence about integrity
   measurements from a device, following the operational context defined
   in TPM-based Network Device Remote Integrity Verification.
   Complementary measurement logs are also provided by the YANG RPCs,
   originating from one or more roots of trust for measurement (RTMs).
   The module defined requires at least one TPM 1.2 or TPM 2.0 as well
   as a corresponding TPM Software Stack (TSS), included in the device
   components of the composite device the YANG server is running on.

Internet-Draft            YANG-CHARRA for TPMs              January 2022


1.  Introduction

   This document is based on the general terminology defined in the
   [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture] and uses the operational context defined
   in [I-D.ietf-rats-tpm-based-network-device-attest] as well as the
   interaction model and information elements defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models].  The currently
   supported hardware security modules (HSMs) are the Trusted Platform
   Modules (TPMs) [TPM1.2] and [TPM2.0] as specified by the Trusted
   Computing Group (TCG).  One or more TPMs embedded in the components
   of a Composite Device are required in order to use the YANG module
   defined in this document.  A TPM is used as a root of trust for
   reporting (RTR) in order to retrieve attestation Evidence from a
   composite device (_TPM Quote_ primitive operation).  Additionally, it
   is used as a root of trust for storage (RTS) in order to retain
   shielded secrets and store system measurements using a folding hash
   function (_TPM PCR Extend_ primitive operation).

   Specific terms imported from [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture] and used in
   this document include: Attester, Composite Device, Evidence.

   Specific terms imported from [TPM2.0-Key] and used in this document
   include: Endorsement Key (EK), Initial Attestation Key (IAK), Local
   Attestation Key (LAK).

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The YANG Module for Basic Remote Attestation Procedures

   One or more TPMs MUST be embedded in a Composite Device that provides
   attestation evidence via the YANG module defined in this document.
   The ietf-basic-remote-attestation YANG module enables a composite
   device to take on the role of an Attester, in accordance with the
   Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) architecture
   [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture], and the corresponding challenge-
   response interaction model defined in the
   [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models] document.  A fresh nonce
   with an appropriate amount of entropy [NIST-915121] MUST be supplied
   by the YANG client in order to enable a proof-of-freshness with
   respect to the attestation Evidence provided by the Attester running
   the YANG datastore.  Further, this nonce is used to prevent replay
   attacks.  The method for communicating the relationship of each

   individual TPM to specific measured component within the Composite
   Device is out of the scope of this document.

2.1.  YANG Modules

   In this section the several YANG modules are defined.

2.1.1.  'ietf-tpm-remote-attestation'

   This YANG module imports modules from [RFC6991], [RFC8348],
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore], and ietf-tcg-algs.yang Section 2.1.2.3.

2.1.1.1.  Features

   This module supports the following features:

   *  'TPMs': Indicates that multiple TPMs on the device can support
      remote attestation.  This feature is applicable in cases where
      multiple line cards are present, each with its own TPM.

   *  'bios': Indicates that the device supports the retrieval of BIOS/
      UEFI event logs. [bios-log]

   *  'ima': Indicates that the device supports the retrieval of event
      logs from the Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA).
      [ima-log]

   *  'netequip_boot': Indicates that the device supports the retrieval
      of netequip boot event logs.  [netequip-boot-log]

2.1.1.2.  Identities

   This module supports the following types of attestation event logs:
   'bios', 'ima', and 'netequip_boot'.

2.1.1.3.  Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)

   In the following, RPCs for both TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0 attestation
   procedures are defined.

2.1.1.3.1.  'tpm12-challenge-response-attestation'

   This RPC allows a Verifier to request signed TPM PCRs (_TPM Quote_
   operation) from a TPM 1.2 compliant cryptoprocessor.  Where the
   feature 'TPMs' is active, and one or more 'certificate-name' is not
   provided, all TPM 1.2 compliant cryptoprocessors will respond.  A
   YANG tree diagram of this RPC is as follows:

2.1.1.3.2.  'tpm20-challenge-response-attestation'

   This RPC allows a Verifier to request signed TPM PCRs (_TPM Quote_
   operation) from a TPM 2.0 compliant cryptoprocessor.  Where the
   feature 'TPMs' is active, and one or more 'certificate-name' is not
   provided, all TPM 2.0 compliant cryptoprocessors will respond.  A
   YANG tree diagram of this RPC is as follows:

   model.  For more details, please see the YANG model itself in
   Figure 1.

   Container 'rats-support-structures':  This houses the set of
      information relating to a device's TPM(s).

   Container 'tpms':  Provides configuration and operational details for
      each supported TPM, including the tpm-firmware-version, PCRs which
      may be quoted, certificates which are associated with that TPM,
      and the current operational status.  Of note are the certificates
      which are associated with that TPM.  As a certificate is
      associated with a particular TPM attestation key, knowledge of the
      certificate allows a specific TPM to be identified.

            necessarily make it easy for a Verifier to appraise just the
            minimum set of PCR information which has changed since the last
            received TPM2B_DIGEST.  Put another way, why should a Verifier
            reconstruct the proper value of all PCR Quotes when only a
            single PCR has changed?
            To help this happen, if the Attester does know specific PCR
            values, the Attester can provide these individual values via

            what has previously been validated, it is possible for a
            Verifier to confirm the Attester's signature while eliminating
            significant processing.  There should never be a result where
            an unsigned PCR value is actually that that within a quote.

2.1.2.  'ietf-tcg-algs'

   Cryptographic algorithm types were initially included within -v14
   NETCONF's iana-crypto-types.yang.  Unfortunately, all this content
   including the algorithms needed here failed to make the -v15 used
   WGLC.  As a result, this document has encoded the TCG Algorithm
   definitions of [TCG-Algos], revision 1.32.  By including this full
   table as a separate YANG file within this document, it is possible
   for other YANG models to leverage the contents of this model.

2.1.2.1.  Features

   There are two types of features supported: 'TPM12' and 'TPM20'.
   Support for either of these features indicates that a cryptoprocessor
   supporting the corresponding type of TCG TPM API is present on an
   Attester.  Most commonly, only one type of cryptoprocessor will be
   available on an Attester.

2.1.2.2.  Identities

   There are three types of identities in this model:

   1.  *Cryptographic functions* supported by a TPM algorithm; these
       include: 'asymmetric', 'symmetric', 'hash', 'signing',
       'anonymous_signing', 'encryption_mode', 'method', and
       'object_type'.  The definitions of each of these are in Table 2
       of [TCG-Algos].

   2.  *API specifications* for TPMs: 'tpm12' and 'tpm20'

   3.  *Specific algorithm types*: Each algorithm type defines what
       cryptographic functions may be supported, and on which type of
       API specification.  It is not required that an implementation of

       a specific TPM will support all algorithm types.  The contents of
       each specific algorithm mirrors what is in Table 3 of
       [TCG-Algos].

   Note that not all cryptographic functions are required for use by
   ietf-tpm-remote-attestation.yang.  However the full definition of
   Table 3 of [TCG-Algos] will allow use by additional YANG
   specifications.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following namespace URIs in the "ns"
   class of the IETF XML Registry [IANA.xml-registry] as per [RFC3688]:

   URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tpm-remote-attestation

      XML:  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers the following YANG modules in the "YANG
   Module Names" registry [IANA.yang-parameters] as per Section 14 of
   [RFC6020]:

   Name:  ietf-tpm-remote-attestation

      Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tpm-remote-
         attestation

      Prefix:  tpm

   Name:  ietf-tcg-algs

      Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tcg-algs

      Prefix:  taa

      Reference:  draft-ietf-rats-yang-tpm-charra (RFC form)

4.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module ietf-tpm-remote-attestation.yang specified in this
   document defines a schema for data that is designed to be accessed
   via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport
   layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure
   Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., _config true_, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., _edit-config_)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   as well as their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Container '/rats-support-structures/attester-supported-algos':  'tpm1



Birkholz, et al.          Expires 14 July 2022                 [Page 48]

      2-asymmetric-signing', 'tpm12-hash', 'tpm20-asymmetric-signing',
      and 'tpm20-hash'.  All could be populated with algorithms that are
      not supported by the underlying physical TPM installed by the
      equipment vendor.

   Container: '/rats-support-structures/tpms':  'name': Although shown
      as 'rw', it is system generated.  Therefore it should not be
      possible for an operator to add or remove a TPM from the
      configuration.

      'tpm20-pcr-bank': It is possible to configure PCRs for extraction
      which are not being extended by system software.  This could
      unnecessarily use TPM resources.

      'certificates': It is possible to provision a certificate which
      does not correspond to an Attestation Identity Key (AIK) within
      the TPM 1.2, or an Attestation Key (AK) within the TPM 2.0
      respectively.

   RPC 'tpm12-challenge-response-attestation':  It must be verified that
      the certificate is for an active AIK, i.e., the certificate
      provided is able to support Attestation on the targeted TPM 1.2.

   RPC 'tpm20-challenge-response-attestation':  It must be verified that
      the certificate is for an active AK, i.e., the quote signature
      associated with RPC response has been generated by an entity
      legitimately able to perform Attestation on the targeted TPM 2.0.

   RPC 'log-retrieval':  Requesting a large volume of logs from the
      attester could require significant system resources and create a
      denial of service.

   Information collected through the RPCs above could reveal that
   specific versions of software and configurations of endpoints that
   could identify vulnerabilities on those systems.  Therefore RPCs
   should be protected by NACM [RFC8341] to limit the extraction of
   attestation data by only authorized Verifiers.

   For the YANG module ietf-tcg-algs.yang, please use care when
   selecting specific algorithms.  The introductory section of
   [TCG-Algos] highlights that some algorithms should be considered
   legacy, and recommends implementers and adopters diligently evaluate
   available information such as governmental, industrial, and academic
   research before selecting an algorithm for use.
